Evolutionary Decision Tree Induction Algorithms

Automatic design of interpretable and efficient decision tree algorithms using evolutionary computation.

This project tackles the problem of automatically designing decision-tree induction algorithms using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Each individual in the population represents a candidate algorithm encoded as a linear genome of nine genes, each controlling one core aspect of the tree induction process.

The aim is to balance predictive performance and model simplicity, especially when evolving interpretable models in constrained or real-world scenarios.
